# Variant Human

This is a Variant Human race for Baldur's Gate 3. It doesn't replace Human, it is a new race.

Level 1 feat can be selected at character creation. Some less important feats haven't been included. For half-feat, I have chosen the most relevant ability score increase. It may not fit everyone and it is possible to create 2 versions. For example, Athlete Strength, Athlete Dexterity

Please note that these requirements are not listed in description. I might add them in a future release:
| Feat                      | Requirement                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Defensive Duelist         | Dexterity: 13+                    |
| Moderately Armored        | Light Armor proficiency           |
| Heavily Armored           | Medium Armor proficiency          |
| Heavy Armor Master        | Heavy Armor proficiency           |
| Medium Armor Master       | Medium Armor proficiency          |
