# Variant Human

You have to install variantHumanCore.pak file, it contains everything but most feats.

These feats can be selected when creating a character:
- Actor
- Alert
- Charger
- Defensive Duelist
- Durable
- Heavily Armored
- Heavy Armor Master
- Lightly Armored (dexterity bonus)
- Medium Armor Master
- Moderately Armored (dexterity bonus)
- Resilient (Constitution)
- Savage Attacker
- Tough

If you want another one, you must choose one feat pak and installs it after variantHumanCore. When creating a character, select None for Feat as it will automatically included within Variant Human.

Please note that there is no requirement check for feat. Nothing prevents you to choose Heavy Armour feat for a human wizard:

| Feat                      | Requirement                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Defensive Duelist         | Dexterity: 13+                    |
| Moderately Armored        | Light Armor proficiency           |
| Heavily Armored           | Medium Armor proficiency          |
| Heavy Armor Master        | Heavy Armor proficiency           |
| Medium Armor Master       | Medium Armor proficiency          |

## Known issues

It seems that Variant Human race doesn't appear if several feat PAKs are installed, even if only one is activated. So make sure to install only one at a time, and permanently delete it before installing another one.
