# Variant Human

You have to install variantHumanCore.pak file, it contains everything but level 1 feat.

Then, you must choose one feat pak and installs it after variantHumanCore.

Please note that there is no requirement check for feat. Nothing prevents you to choose Heavy Armour feat for a human wizard:

| Feat                      | Requirement                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Defensive Duelist         | Dexterity: 13+                    |
| Moderately Armored        | Light Armor proficiency           |
| Heavily Armored           | Medium Armor proficiency          |
| Heavy Armor Master        | Heavy Armor proficiency           |
| Medium Armor Master       | Medium Armor proficiency          |

## Known issues

It seems that Variant Human race doesn't appear if several feat PAKs are installed, even if only one is activated. So make sure to install only one at a time, and permanently delete it before installing another one.
