# Variant Human Feat

Requires mod: 
- 5eRules

This adds a level 1 feat for variant human race.

You must choose one pak and installs it after mod 5eRules.

Please note that there is no requirement check for feat. Nothing prevents you to choose Heavy Armour feat for a human wizard:

| Feat                      | Requirement                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Defensive Duelist         | Dexterity: 13+                    |
| Moderately Armored        | Light Armor proficiency           |
| Heavily Armored           | Medium Armor proficiency          |
| Heavy Armor Master        | Heavy Armor proficiency           |
| Medium Armor Master       | Medium Armor proficiency          |

## Known issues

It seems that Variant Human race doesn't appear if several feat PAKs are installed, even if only one is activated.
